## summary

<p>This year has been an amazing one for the world of cryptocurrencies. DeFi, the finance built for the internet age. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has really taken off, with numbers that are beyond impressive. DeFi can do everything what traditional finance does today even faster, cheaper and in an efficient way. Still, experts warn that this should not be interpreted as a sign of widespread adoption. For DeFi to be used by the masses, it needs to move from being viewed as a speculative investment to being a platform that people actively engage with. Companies should focus on creating sustainable ways of encouraging users to participate in the governance and maintenance of the network. People also need to gain a better understanding of the protocols that power DeFi applications. If this is achieved, it will enable to refine the DeFi experience. And it's better when knowledge of utilising the power of DeFi technology is spread across <s>millions</s> billions of people round the globe. </p>
  
<p>DeFi, users could do anything from payments and trading to borrowing and investing in blockchain-based games through personal crypto wallets, which eliminates the need for the largest crypto exchanges. Despite the potential of DeFi to restructure the banking system, the costly entry point for newcomers, confusing UX/UI, lack of trust, and complex financial products are preventing DeFi from becoming widely accepted. </p>

<p>DeFi offers a variety of tools, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which are digital marketplaces where users can purchase and sell digital resources without a central entity, lending protocols that permit users to borrow and lend digital property to obtain interest, stablecoins that are digital forms of currency with a fixed worth often secured by other digital assets or fiat currency, non-custodial wallets that provide users a way to store their digital belongings with no third-party custodian, automated markets makers (AMMs) which are algorithms that automatically match buyers and sellers in a market to provide liquidity, and decentralized insurance that offers users a platform to insure their digital assets against various risks.</p>

<p>Our vision is to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the DeFi space that acts as a bridge between users and the world of DeFi. Our DAO aims to assist users in navigating the DeFi landscape, making it more accessible and user-friendly. Despite the growing popularity of DeFi, people are still struggling in getting grasp of its existence and the benefits it offers. Moreover, for those who wish to do ventures in DeFi, the steep learning curve is making it difficult to get started. Another major issue faced by DeFi users is the lack of understanding about the potential risks involved especially for those providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). There comes our DAO to rescue, it will help in educating users on these potential risks and provide resources to mitigate them, making it easier for anyone to get involved in DeFi with confidence than ever before!</p>

<p>It is tricky to give an exact figure of DeFi users, but the most recent statistics point to a figure of over 10 million individuals across the world. The United States, Japan, South Korea, China, and the United Kingdom are the leading countries in terms of DeFi usage, while India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico are lagging. To maximize DeFi's potential and draw more users, developers and platforms should concentrate on the primary advantages that the technology offers, like higher security, transparency, and availability. Additionally, they should strive to make the user experience as straightforward and user-friendly as possible, in addition to providing educational content to help users comprehend DeFi services and how to use them. Finally, it is essential to build a strong community of users, which will help promote adoption and guarantee the long-term success of the platform. </p>
